The Arva SDK was developed to create 3d graphic programms with a pleasant developer experience. It supports mobile, desktop and the web. 
### Development with the Arva SDK
The Arva SDK comprises the engine, the packages and the arva tool. It is designed in such a way that you can hack parts of the engine in the same process of creating a game to change and add basic features completely dynamically. It supports hot reload for C and for Dart to increase the speed of the development process.

There are user interfaces to access the sdk, these are supplied as part of the Intellj and VSCode plugins later.
