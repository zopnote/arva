# Arva CLI tooling
The Arva SDK comes with many features, multiple languages and layers, dependencies and binaries. 
These results in a need of tooling for dependency 
management and the processes of development, debug and production.
## Main structure
The tooling is participated in tasks, grouped around the entry point and written in Dart.
